# Updates and Support

## Checking Your Version

Open [System Status](system-status.md) to see the software version currently installed and whether
a newer release is available.

Click **Check for updates** to refresh the information. If the release server is unreachable, the
page explains the problem and may show information from the last successful check.

## Version History

Open **Version history** from **System Status**. In standby, select
**View version history and install updates**. The page's return link takes you back to
**System Status** or standby, depending on the unit's current power state.

### Reading the Release List

Each entry shows the version, available release date and release stage. **Installed** identifies
the release on your unit; **Newer than installed** identifies later releases. Expand
**Release notes** beneath an entry to read its changes. If notes are unavailable, the entry says so.

**Show release candidates and betas** includes nonfinal releases that are still being tested.
It is enabled initially. Turning it off hides other nonfinal entries, but your installed release
and releases newer than it remain visible. A visible entry is therefore not necessarily a final
release; check its release stage before installing.

Select **Show … older versions** below the list to reveal the remaining entries. Versions before
2.0 are not listed. To return to the 1.x series, follow the **Downgrade page** link and the
[version 1.x downgrade precautions](#upgrading-from-version-1x); do not use a normal release
installation for that migration.

### Refreshing and Connection Problems

Select **Check for updates** to refresh release information. **Last checked** shows when the
information was checked. If the release server is unreachable, the warning reports the failed
check and the list comes from the last successful check; newer releases may be missing. Check
the HTP-1's internet connection and select **Check for updates** again.

If software information cannot be loaded, select **Try again**. If no releases are found, check
the unit's internet connection and refresh the list.

## Installing an Update

1. Read the selected release's **Release notes** and check its release stage.
2. Select **Install** for a listed newer or older release, or **Reinstall** for your current release.
3. In the confirmation, compare **Installed now** with **Will install**. Select **Cancel** to leave
   the current version unchanged, or **Install** followed by the version number to proceed.
4. Wait for installation and the automatic restart to finish. Confirm the installed version on
   **System Status** when the interface reconnects.

!!! warning "Returning to an older release"
    Settings saved by newer software may not carry over to older software. Export your configuration
    before changing versions and review the selected release's requirements. Returning to version
    1.x requires the separate downgrade procedure described above.

!!! tip
    Export your configuration before updating. See [Backup and Restore](configs.md).
    Configuration exports do not include Dirac Live filter files.

## What to Expect

During installation, the web interface displays progress messages and a progress bar. Installation
may take several minutes. Audio and HDMI pass-through stop while the unit restarts.
Do not disconnect power while the update is running.

The HTP-1 restarts automatically when installation finishes. Open browser tabs reconnect and reload
when the unit becomes available again.

During startup, you may see **HTP-1 is starting** or **Preparing Dirac Live filters**.

The first startup after updating may take longer because the HTP-1 checks its stored Dirac Live
filters and prepares missing filter versions.

Your existing settings and calibrations are preserved during a normal firmware update.

## Upgrading from Version 1.x

Moving from version 1.x to version 2 replaces the Dirac Live filter system. Existing version 1.x
filters cannot be used by version 2; you will need to run a new Dirac Live calibration.

This is a one-time migration. If your HTP-1 already runs version 2.x, use the normal update procedure
above.

Before starting, export your configuration and keep your Dirac Live project files separately. A
configuration JSON export does not include the Dirac Live filters.

### Prepare and Install

1. While still running version 1.x, use its software-update controls to install **version 1.13.3**.
   This release includes fixes for the upgrade process and speaker-layout preservation.

2. After the update finishes, open the **Info / Detailed Status** page and follow the
   **ART Preparation** link. If you previously declined the upgrade, use **Prepare for ART Upgrade**.

    *Legacy version 1.13.3 — ART Upgrade Preparation for upgrading from version 1.x.*

3. Before initiating the upgrade, follow the preparation page's link to the filter-save dialog.
   Click **prepare for download**, wait for preparation to finish, then save the files for your
   occupied filter slots to your computer. Audio is interrupted during preparation. These files are
   useful only if you return to version 1.x; they cannot be imported into version 2.

4. Return to **ART Upgrade Preparation**, read the information provided, and click **Initiate Upgrade!**

5. Allow the installation and automatic restarts to finish. Do not disconnect power during the upgrade.

6. Once version 2 is running, check the installed version on **System Status**. Use **Version history**
   to install a newer public release if needed, following the normal update procedure above.

### Your First Calibration Afterward

Check that the **Speakers** page shows your intended speaker layout before starting Dirac Live.
Correct the layout if necessary and wait for any configuration operation to finish.

Run a new Dirac Live calibration and transfer the resulting filters to the HTP-1. The filters used
under version 1.x are not available for playback under version 2.

Review your Volume Setup and Calibration settings after migration. The upgrade resets
calibration-related configuration, so do not assume that every previous value has carried over.

If Dirac Live reports a problem, follow the status message and recovery action on the **Calibration**
page. See [Dirac Live](dirac.md#dirac-live-status).

!!! warning "Returning to version 1.x"
    Returning to version 1.x requires the dedicated downgrade procedure rather than a normal
    version-history installation. It removes the version 2 filters and attempts to restore the
    pre-upgrade filters. Restoration is not guaranteed. Keep your downloaded version 1.x filter
    backups and Dirac Live project files separately.

### Downloading Logs

Open **Device Settings → Danger Zone** and click **Download Logs**. This downloads a diagnostic ZIP
archive containing logs and the current configuration. Its filename includes the unit's serial number
and the download date and time. Review the archive before sharing it publicly.

Send this file along when you report a problem — it gives the development team the detail needed
to reproduce and diagnose it.

### Community Discussion

Much of the HTP-1 owners' discussion about setup, troubleshooting, features, and software updates
takes place in the
[AVS Forum HTP-1 owners thread](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/the-official-monoprice-monolith-htp-1-owners-thread.3112176/).
You can also find this link under **Discussion** on the [System Status](system-status.md) page.
